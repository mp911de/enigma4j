/**
 * Configurable patching of characters swaps supported by military editions of Enigma. The
 * patch bay allows up to 10 re-routing of letter mappings. Each mapping must be unique
 * and cannot overlap with already existing mappings.
 * <p>
 * Patching allows routing of characters so that {@code A} can be swapped with {@code T}
 * and vice-versa. To specify a patch mapping, use the {@link #withPatch(String)} method.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 *       Patching patching = â€¦;
 *       patching.withPatch("AE").withPatch("TZ");
